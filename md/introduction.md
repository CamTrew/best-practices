Following best practices and conventions improves the quality and consistency of a codebase. There are many great style guides out there for Go, such as:
- [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
- [Uber's Style Guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md)
- [Ardan Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com/)

These resources have influenced the conventions listed in this guide. However, we have taken a different approach by tackling more day-to-day concerns. Many surface-level issues will be solved by gofmt and your linter, so we will be digging deeper than that.

This guide is dynamic and should evolve over time. If you have any additions or modifications, please create a merge request and leave a comment with your explanation.
